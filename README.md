# HeterogeneousAspDyn

The two folders contain the simulation codes for for the paper: **Aspiration dynamics generate robust predictions in heterogeneous populations**, by *Lei Zhou*, *Bin Wu*, *Jinming Du*, and *Long Wang*. 

The folder *PayoffMatrix_abcd* generate simulation resutls for the game payoff matrix parameterized by $a, b, c, d$ where $b, c, d$ are fixed values, and the folder *PayoffMatrix_RSTP* generate simulation resutls for the game payoff matrix parameterized by by $R, S, T, P$ where $R=1$ and $P=0$. 

Detailed description of each simulation program can be found in the README.md file in the corresponding folder.
